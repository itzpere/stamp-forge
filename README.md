## üë§ Author

**Created by Petar Miletiƒá** - [github.com/itzpere](https://github.com/itzpere)

## üî¥ Essential Downloads

**[DOWNLOAD STAMP HOLDER](https://www.printables.com/model/1285748-stampforge-customizable-svg-to-stamp)** - This holder is required to use your created stamps

## Features

- Import SVG files and convert them to 3D models
- Adjust extrusion scale on working plane
- Position the extrusion on the stamp base
- View models in real-time 3D
- Export models as STL files for 3D printing
- Browse the SVG gallery to quickly select designs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itzpere/stamp-forge.git
   cd stamp-forge
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Upload an SVG**: Use the upload button to select an SVG file from your computer
2. **Customize**: 
   - Adjust the extrusion height
   - Set the scale to size the design
   - Position the design on the stamp base using the X, Y, Z offset controls
3. **Preview**: Rotate, pan, and zoom to inspect your 3D model
4. **Export**: Click "Download STL" to export your model for 3D printing

## Printing Tips

For best results when 3D printing your stamps:

- **Enable ironing** on top-most surfaces in your slicer for a smooth finish on the stamp face
- Use a relatively high infill (40%+) for durability
- Consider printing with a flexible material for better stamping results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Positioning System Instability:** The positioning system in the current alpha version is unstable. If you experience issues, try refreshing the page.
- This is an alpha version with ongoing development to improve stability and features
